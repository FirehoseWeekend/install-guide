Firehose Weekend Environment Install Guide
---------------

There are a few different options you have to install your web development environment.

### [Vagrant Install](https://github.com/kenmazaika/firehose-vagrant)

Supports: _Windows, Mac OS_

This will setup your web development environment using a tool called Vagrant.  

**In short**: this method will allow you to run with a pre-installed web development environment once you install a couple of programs.  Once you're up and running all you'll need to do is run a few commands to connect we accounts to it.

If you're curious to learn more, you read up on the nitty-gritty details about Vagrant [here](http://www.vagrantup.com/) (entirely optional).

**This process is the fastest, and the easiest**.

### [Boxen Install](manual.md)

Supports: _Mac OS 10.8 and Mac OS 10.9_

This will setup your web development environment using a tool called Boxen.  

**In short**: this method will automatically run your machine through the install process.  It's a lot like the manual process, but instead of actually running through a lot of the steps, there is a program, called boxen, that will run through many of the steps for you.

If you're curious to learn more, you read up on the nitty-gritty details about Boxen [here](http://boxen.github.com/) (entirely optional).

**This process is a little longer than the vagrant process, and a little bit harder**.


### [Manual Process](manual.md)
Supports: _Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu_  

**In short**: you can manually install all the programs that you'll need to on your machine.

This will give you fine grained control since you'll be installing everything by hand.  This should be used as a fall-back if either the Vagrant or Boxen installs are not possible.

**This process is the hardest to complete, and will take the longest**.
