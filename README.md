Firehose Weekend Environment Install Guide
---------------

### [Vagrant Install](https://github.com/kenmazaika/firehose-vagrant)

Supports: _Windows, Mac OS_

This will setup your web development environment using a tool called Vagrant.  

In short: this method will allow you to run with a pre-installed web development environment once you install a couple of programs.  Once your up and running all you'll need to do is run a few commands to connect we accounts to it.

If you're curious to learn more, you read up on the nitty-gritty details about Vagrant [here](http://www.vagrantup.com/) (entirely optional).

**This process is the fastest, and the easiest**.

### [Boxen Install](manual.md)

Supports: _Mac OS 10.8 and Mac OS 10.9_

This will setup your web development environment using a tool called Boxen.  

In short: this method will automatically run your machine through the install process.  It's a lot like the manual process, but instead of actually running through a lot of the steps, there is a program, called boxen, that will run through many of the steps for you.

If you're curious to learn more, you read up on the nitty-gritty details about Boxen [here](http://boxen.github.com/) (entirely optional).

**This process is a little longer than the vagrant process, and a little bit harder**.


### [Manual Process](manual.md)
Supports: _Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu_  

This will give you fine grained control since you'll be installing everything by hand.

**This process is the hardest to complete, and will take the longest**.
